Instructions to set it up:
Frist of all you need to install NodeJS and MongoDB.
After they are both installed, just start the mongo server, if its not already started:
$ mongodstart
Then install the application dependecies:
$ cd project/location
$ npm install
Then run it:
$ npm start
And that's it!
