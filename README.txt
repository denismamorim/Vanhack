Hello!

Frist of all, I would like to say that you guys gave an excellent challange! I really like doing it.
But unfortunately, because of tha hackton, I couldn't really dedicate all the time I wanted to it, so you will find that my solution is rather... raw. But I do hope that you find it satisfying and juldge it for it's potencial.

Instructions to set it up:
Frist of all you need to install NodeJS and MongoDB.
After they are both installed, just start the mongo server, if its not already started:
$ mongodstart
Then install the application dependecies:
$ cd project/location
$ npm install
Then run it:
$ npm start
And that's it!
